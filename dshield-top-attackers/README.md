# DShield Top Attackers â€“ Custom Python ETL Connector

## Overview
This ETL connector fetches the **Top Attacking IPs** list from the [DShield Internet Storm Center](https://www.dshield.org) and loads it into a MongoDB collection.  
The connector is built as part of the **Kyureeus EdTech / SSN CSE** Software Architecture assignment.

The source data is a plain text feed containing:
- IP address of the attacker
- Number of attacks reported
- Country code

Each record is stored with an ingestion timestamp (`ingested_at`) for audit and update tracking.
